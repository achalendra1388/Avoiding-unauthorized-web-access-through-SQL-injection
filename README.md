# Avoiding-unauthorized-web-access-through-SQL-injection

This project—which focuses on strengthening website security against dangers like
SQL injection and guaranteeing strong user authentication—is essential. Understanding the main risks, such
SQL Injection, in which hackers alter SQL queries to get unauthorized access, and weak authentication,
which is often circumvented, is crucial to your business. This project has a number of security features to
counter this. The usage of prepared statements or parameterized queries, which isolate SQL functionality
from data and lessen risk, is emphasized as a means of preventing SQL injection.the project addresses user authentication procedures as well as SQL injection risks, taking a
complete approach to website security. It serves as evidence that maintaining security calls for constant
attention to detail and adjustment to new threats and technological advancements.

PROBLEM STATEMENT :
How to prevent unauthorized access to websites from SQL injection attacks?
